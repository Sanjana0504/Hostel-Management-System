# Hostel-Management-System
The online hostel management system is web-based software built using HTML, CSS, PHP to provide college students accommodation to the university hostel more efficiently. This website also keeps details of hostellers, applied students which contain administrator and user module.

A PHP web application.
To set this web application, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server.
Next open PHPMyAdmin,import the db.sql file located at database/db.sql. This will generate tables in your database on your server.
The admin user which I have made has an username and the password. (Refer to the credentials in txt file)
Open config.php file and add the details of your PHPMyAdmin's id and password to access the database. Now re-upload this file to the server.
Once this is done, go to the url of your website and it should be up and running.
You can now create student account ,enter their details and login .
Enjoy!
